* interrupts are always enabled in user mode

* in kernel mode, interrupts are disabled:
    - from boot until the first context switch to a user thread
    - immediately after a syscall entry, until the stack is switched to the kernel stack
    - during irq handling, including the scheduler (irq0 timer interrupt) and in the
      keyboard driver (irq1 keyboard interrupt)
    - during exception handlers
    - while a spinlock is being held
    - between releasing the sched lock and switching contexts in the scheduler

* at all other times, the current thread can be interrupted
