* interrupts are always enabled in user mode

* in kernel mode, interrupts are disabled:
    - immediately after a syscall entry, until the stack is switched to the kernel stack
    - during irq handling, including the scheduler (irq0 timer interrupt) and in the
      keyboard driver (irq1 keyboard interrupt)
    - while a spinlock is being held

* at all other times, the current thread can be interrupted
